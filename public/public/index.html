<h1>Ramanujan's Magic square</h1>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Ramanujan%27s_magic_square.jpg" alt="ramanujan's magic square" ></p>
<P> This is a unique type of magic square created by Sir Srinivasa Ramanujan.As we can see that sum of the numbers of any row and sum of numbers of any coloumn are equal that is for example let us take first row 22+12+18+87=139 and first colounm 22+88+10+19=139,sum of the numbers of any diagonal are also equal and it is equal to 139. so many people get a doubt that what is so special in this it will be there in any magic square. </P>

<h2>what's so special about this magic square?</h2>
<p>sum of the corner numbers is also 139 that is 22+11+87+19=139. </p>

<p>Sum of the identical colored boxes in the below figure is also equal to 139.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/ramanujan-magic-square-130706020119-phpapp02/95/ramanujan-magicsquare-7-638.jpg?cb=1373076614"></p>
<p>Sum of the central boxes in the below image is also equal to 139.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/ramanujan-magic-square-130706020119-phpapp02/95/ramanujan-magicsquare-9-638.jpg?cb=1373076614"></p>
<p>Now if you divide the magic square into 4 parts as below we can observe that sum of each part is equal to other and equal to 139.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/ramanujan-magic-square-130706020119-phpapp02/95/ramanujan-magicsquare-10-638.jpg?cb=1373076614"></p>
<p>Sum of the identical colored boxes in the below figure is also equal to 139.It's intresting right.</p>

<p>Now let us see the most intresting part of this magic square,do you remember the birth date of srinivasa ramanujan? it is 22 Dec 1887.If you write the month also in numbers you get 22 12 1887.Did you observe anything? we can observe that the first row of the magic square is filled with birth date of Srinivasa Ramanujan. It is very intresting right.</p>
<h3>How can you make a magic square using your date of birth?</h3>
<p>There are two methods to make a magic square</p>
<ul style="list-style:circle;">
<li>First method is shown below.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><b>step 1</b>:First take a 4*4 matrix and write your birth date as mentioned above in the first row of the matrix.</li>
<li><b>step 2</b>:Now write the same numbers u have written in the first row again but in the reverse order in the second row.</li>
<li><b>step 3</b>:Fill the first two places of the third row with the numbers written in the first two places of first row but in reverse order.And the remaining two places should be filled with the numbers written in last two places of the first row but in reverse order.</li>
<li><b>step 4</b>:Fill the first two places of the fourth row with numbers written in the first two places of the second row but in reverse order.And the remaining two places should be filled with numbrts written in the last two places of the second row but in reverse order.</li>
<li><b>step 5</b>:Now take another 4*4 matrix in which it's first row should be filled with zeroes,second row should be filled with 1,-1,-3,+3 respectively,third row should be filled with  -2,+2,+2,-2 respectively,fourth row should be filled with  -1,+1,-1,+1 respectively</li>
<li><b>step 6</b>:Now add both the matrices the result will be a magic square which is formed using your date of birth. </li>
</ul>
<p>The matrix we get after the addition is shown in the image which is at the top</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Now the second method to get the magic square is:</li>
<p>Except the step number 5 every thing is same.In the 5th step while taking anothe 4*4 matrix fill the first row the zeroes,fillt the second row with m+n,-m-n,n-m,m-n respectively,third row should be filled with -m,+m,+m,-m respectively and the final row should be filled with -n,+n,-n,+n respectively</p>
<p>The matrix will get after the addition is shown below</p>
